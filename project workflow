Project Workflow: Wet Object Detection & Sorting

Start the main loop.

Read the IR sensor to detect if an object is present.

If no object is detected:
  - Rotate the stepper motor back to the home position.
  - Center the servo motor (set to neutral).
  - Wait and repeat the loop.

If an object is detected:
  - Read the rain sensor to check if the object is wet.
  - If the object is wet:
    - Rotate the stepper motor clockwise.
    - Move the servo motor to the open position.
  - If the object is dry:
    - Rotate the stepper motor counterclockwise.
    - Move the servo motor to the open position.

Wait until the stepper motor finishes the rotation.

Repeat from step 1.
